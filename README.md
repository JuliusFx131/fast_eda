## What is this repo about?
Tired of spending “too much time” doing data exploration before training your Machine Learning models?

Looking for a faster way to understand data issues and patterns, before you dive into the fun part of training your ML model?

Wanna learn how to train better ML models, by finding and fixing issues in your data?

In this repo you can find a short Python script that used the Sweetviz
library to do data exploration at the speed of light.

I also invite you to read the original article I published on my site:

[📝 Fast And Easy Data Exploration For Machine Learning](http://datamachines.xyz/2022/06/12/fast-and-easy-data-exploration-for-machine-learning/)


## Quick setup
You need Python >= 3.7 and
```
$ pip install sweetviz
```

## Example
I attached a sample dataset for a churn prediction model, that you
can quickly explore with a one-liner.

```bash
$ python eda.py --file v1.csv --target Churn
```
